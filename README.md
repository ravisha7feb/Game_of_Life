# Game_of_Life
The Famous Conway's Game of Life. This code was an effort to produce infiniteness of this game within a finite boundary of our coding Ide. Not really a Game Development project but a mini project to acquire something close to the Game of Life.

Okay so for creating a file containing the grid of live and dead cells I wrote a python code(game_file.py). That gave me the required grid and I saved it in game_file.txt. I started with a grid of dimensions 30 X 30. Using that in the code (game_of_life.py) I proceed with the game. 

I have denoted dead cells with 0 and live cells with 1. I ask the user to input X if they wish to see how the next generation of live and dead cells would be. If they do I change the grid according to the rules of the game. Otherwise, if any other input is given, I keep on changing the generations internally unless and until the user wishes to see the next generation. 
This was my idea to squeeze infiniteness into finite boundaries. Any suggestions are welcome.
